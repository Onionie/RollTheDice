# Dice Game
A simple dice roller created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

# What I learned and Used
- To create a simple dice roller using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- JavaScript functions:
	- Query selectors
	- Math functions 
	- Random functions

# How It Works
- Press the refresh button (F5) to refresh the page and both dice will roll new values.
- If Player 1's dice is greater than Player 2's dice, then Player 1 wins.
- If Player 1's dice is less than Player 2's dice, then Player 2 wins
- If both Player's dice are the same, then it is a draw.
